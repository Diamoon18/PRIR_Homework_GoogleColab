### What is it SAXPY?
SAXPY stands for “Single-Precision A·X Plus Y”. \
It is a function in the standard Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS)library.\
SAXPY is a combination of scalar multiplication and vector addition, and it’s very simple:\
```it takes as input two vectors of 32-bit floats X and Y with N elements each, and a scalar value A``` \
It multiplies each element X[i] by A and adds the result to Y[i].\
